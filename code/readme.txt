About Project:
- This Timetable Scheduler Android app, Krono provides reminders for classes, tutorials, holidays, exams to IIT Bombay students and a lot more features.
- Based on the courses selected by the users from our database which we acquire from asc, Krono creates the events for the classes corresponding to the courses.
- It shows an overview of a week and a scheduler view with different color schemes for different type of events e.g., classes, assignment deadlines, exams, and
  user-created events and set reminders according to the user.
- Krono has a list of holidays that are meant for IIT Bombay students only (taken from IITB holidays list). The user can also change venue or timing of classes.
- There is a seperate section for getting list of institute events and adding them to calendar.
